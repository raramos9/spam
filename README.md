# Spam Email Classification

This project aims to build a robust spam email classifier using logistic regression. The model filters spam emails by identifying key spam words based on labeled and unlabeled samples. Through feature engineering, model training, and hyperparameter tuning, the classifier is evaluated and optimized for reliable spam detection.

## Project Overview

The spam email classification system leverages machine learning techniques to identify spam emails with high accuracy. By preprocessing the data, employing feature engineering methods like one-hot encoding, and using logistic regression for classification, the system achieves a high training accuracy of approximately 90%.

### Key Features
- **Data Processing**: Processed over 10,000 labeled and unlabeled samples.
- **Feature Engineering**: Applied one-hot encoding to convert categorical data into numerical features.
- **Model**: Used logistic regression for binary classification (spam or not).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized the model using GridSearchCV to find the best parameters.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curve visualization.
